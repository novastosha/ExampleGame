Every map info file, needs to have the name of the world as it's file name.

Eg. World name is Example20
    The map info file is required to be Example20
    Not doing so will cause errors when parsing the YML because Bukkit does not load worlds
Please note: Using multiverse or mutliworld could cause conflicts.
